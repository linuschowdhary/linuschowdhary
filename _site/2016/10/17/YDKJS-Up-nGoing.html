<p>UP &amp; GOING:-
Though asserted that JS is interpreted language as JS code is processed each time it’s run, it’s not entirely true.
The JS engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

<p>To type multiple lines into console at once : <shift>+<enter>
Once hit <enter>, code executes.</enter></enter></shift></p>

<p>Accessing an object property
obj.a is same as obj[“a”]</p>

<p>var b=Number(“5”);
console.log(b);
–&gt;5 //instead of “5”</p>

<p>==  loose equals</p>

<p>“99.99”==99.99 //js will convert LHS “99.99” to its number equivalent 99.99 and thus becomes true.</p>

<p>Comments should explain why not what but can explain how if code is confusing</p>

<p>Javascript uses dynamic typing approach meaning variables can hold values of any type without any type enforcement.
Declare constants at top of program so as easier to go at one place to alter a value.Convention is to use Caps with underscore b/w words.
var TAX_RATE=0.08; //8% sales tax</p>

<p>ES5 added “strict mode” which applies restriction to certain behaviours to keep code safer.
We can opt for strict mode for an individual function or an entire file depending on where we put the strict mode</p>

<p>“use strict”;
one of many advantages,Strict mode disallows implicit auto global variable declaration from omitting the var.
function foo(){
“use strict”; // turn on strict mode
 a=1; //’var’ missing , ReferenceError
}</p>

<p>Functions as values:
function foo(){
}
here foo is just a variable in the outer enclosing scope that’s given a reference to the function being declared ie.e. function itelsef is a value.</p>

<p>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)
(function IIFE(){console.log(“IIFE”);})();
The outer (fun… ) is a just a nuance of JS grammer to prevent it from being treated
as a normal function declaration.
IEFE can have return values :-
var x=(function(){return 42;})();</p>

<p>Closure:
A way to remember and continue to access a function’s scope(it’s variables) even once the function has finished running.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<p>function makeAdder(x){</p>

<p>function add(y){
   return y+x;
   };</p>

<p>return add;
}</p>

<p>var plusOne=add(1); // plusOne gets a reference to the inner ‘add(..)’ function 
                    // with closure over the ‘x’ parameter of the outer
                    // ‘makeAdder(1)’
plusOne(2) // returns 3</p>

<p>var plusTen=add(10);
plusTen(12); // returns 22
/* 
How above code works : 
when we call makeAdder(1), we get back a reference to its inner add(..) that remembers x as 1. We
call this function reference plusOne(..).
When we call plusOne(2), it adds 2 (it’s inner y) to the 1 (remembered by x) and we get 3 as a result.
*/</p>

<p>Module: 
Most common usage of closure in JS is the module pattern.
Module lets us define private implementation details(variables,functions)
that are hidden from outside world, as well as a public API that is accessible from the outside.</p>

<p>function User(){
    var username,password;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>function doLogin(user,pw){
username=user;
password=pw;;
//do the rest of the login work
}

var publicAPI={
login:doLogin
};
return publicAPI; }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>//create a ‘User’ module instance
var fred=User();
fred.login(“fred”,”password@1234”);</p>

<p>The User() function serves as an outer scope that holds the variables username and password,
as well as the inner doLogin() function; these are all private inner details of this User module
that cannot be accessed from the outside world.</p>

<p>this identifier :-
If a function has this reference inside it , that this reference usually points to an object. But which 
object it points to depends on how the function was called.</p>

<p>function foo(){
console.log(this.bar);
}
var bar=”global”;</p>

<p>var obj1={
bar:”obj1”,
foo:foo
}</p>

<p>var obj2={
bar:”obj2”
}</p>

<p>foo(); //global     | sets this to the global js object in no strict mode , 
                      in strict mode it would be undefined and would get an error
                      in accessing bar property. 
obj1.foo(); //”obj1” |  sets this to the obj1 object
foo.call(obj2); //”obj2” | sets this to the obj2 object
new foo(); //undefined | sets this to brand new empty object</p>

<p>Prototypes :-
When you reference a property on an object,if that property doesn’t exist, JS will automatically use
that objec’s internal prototype reference to find another object to look for the property on.Think of it as fallback if property is missing.
The internal prototype reference linkage from one object to its fallback happens at the time the object is created. 
It can be illustrated with built-in utility called Object.create(..) .</p>

<p>var foo={
a:42
};</p>

<p>var bar=Object.create(foo); // create ‘bar’ and link it to ‘foo’</p>

<p>bar.b=”hello”;</p>

<hr />
<p>|    bar   | —prototype link——-&gt; |  foo    |
|  b:hello |                           |  a:42   | 
  ———                              ——-</p>

<p>bar.b; //”hello”
bar.a; //42 &lt;– delegated to ‘foo’</p>

<p>The a property does not actually exist on bar object, but because bar is prototype-linked to foo, JS
automatically falls back to looking for a on the foo object, where it’s found.’
Used in pattern behavior delegation where you intentionally design your linked objects to be able to 
delegate from one to other for parts of needed behavior.</p>
